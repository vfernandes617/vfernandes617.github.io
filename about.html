            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I am an inspired software developer, a new father of one, and a dreamer with a boundless imagination. I have always had a passion for creating games. As a child, I would often invent games for my friends and me to play—whether it was make-believe Pokémon adventures or pretending we knew the rules of Yu-Gi-Oh.

In adulthood, that creativity evolved into designing games for social gatherings, from drinking games to makeshift board games. My greatest joy comes from the creative process—imagining something that people will enjoy and then watching them have fun with it.
                <br>
                <br>I am a graduate of <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a>’s Software Developer Boot Camp, and trained and experienced in the following web and programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C# and more.
                <br>
                <br>I am a game developer and would love to work with you on your project. <a href="mailto:valterfernandes817@gmail.com">Contact me</a>
