                I am an inspired software developer. A new father of one and a boundless imagination. I always had a passion for creating games. As a child I would often make up games for me and my friends to play, whether that is make beleive pokemon or to pretending to know what the rules of Yuigioh were.
                In my adult life we transitioned to creating games that involed drinking or make shift board games. The biggest enjoyment I would get  from this was the fun process of coming up something people would enjoy and seeing other
                enjoy something you came up with.
